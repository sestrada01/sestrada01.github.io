<!-- Extend the Madlib so that it has at least 8 different words-->
<p> Here's a madlib about a kid named <span id = "name1">____</span>  who had an imaginary friend <span id = "name2"> ____</span>. One day the two of them went up a hill and found a pot of <span id = "noun1"> _____ </span>. They decided to go to the park where they decided to play <span id = "sport1"> ___</span> together. Eventually they got hungry and left the park to go eat <span id = "food1"> ___</span>. They were so full that they decided to go <span id = "activity1"> ___ </span> to help digest some of the food. They got thirsty so they decided to go drink some <span id = "drink1">___ </span>. While at the store they got some <span id = "snack1">___ </span>.</p> 

	<script>  //The Javascript goes in this section below 
    
//demo 1 shows replacement of HTML text
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello World!";

//demo 2 shows concatenation of HTML text
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML += "dr og";

//demo 3 shows a prompt which stores info as a variable
//demo 3 shows a prompt which stores info as a variable

var name = prompt("Please enter your name");

document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = "Hello " + name + "! How are you today?";



//Put the Madlib JS Code below here. Extend this code so that asks for 8 different inputs and prints them all out


var name1 = prompt("Give me a name");
var name2 = prompt("Give me another name");
var noun1 = prompt("Give me an appropriate object");
var sport1 = prompt("Give me a sport");
var food1=prompt("Give me a food")
var activity1= prompt("Give me an activity")
var drink1= prompt("Give me a drink")
var snack1= prompt("Give me a snack")

document.getElementById("name1").innerHTML = name1;
document.getElementById("name2").innerHTML = name2;
document.getElementById("noun1").innerHTML = noun1;
document.getElementById("sport1").innerHTML= sport1; 
document.getElementById("food1").innerHTML = food1;
