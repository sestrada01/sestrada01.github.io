<h3>Music</h3>	
Hello welcome to my "About Me" page. I will be going over some things about myself on this page. Something about me is that I enjoy listening to music. I don't have a specific genre that's my favorite since I'm always listening to diffent styles of music and take suggestions of others. Some of my top genres include pop, kpop, and punk. I also enjoy watching different genre of movies and tv shows. Some of my favorite genres include, crime, horror, kdramas, and mysteries. I also enjoy rollerskating. 

<h3>Extracurriculars</h3>
I have participated in multiple after school activities throughout high school. One of my favorite ones I have participated on is bowling. I've been part of the team since sophmore year but due to the pandemic, I only played for 2 out of the 3 seasons. Some other things I participated in include, badminton, cooking club, C.A.P, and other things too. 
<h3>Animals</h3>
	I currently am a pet owner of two dogs. Their names are Prince and Cookie. I used to have a third dog since they were all one happy family but sadly the mother passed away due to health complications. I also have a hamster who loves running around in her wheel. Shes almost one year old and enjoyed witnessing her growth.
