  <h1><em> All about Sofia </em></h1>
  <p> Im kind of bad at making these type of things.I am a Junior at Bronx Early College Academy. Im not the most creative person but I try my best. I can be a little slow and childish sometimes. Im kind of shy and am quiet when I meet someone for the first time. I enjoy being around my family and spending time with them. I enjoy listening to different types of genres of music. I also enjoy talking with my friends. My friends (Bianca and Jacqueline) and I joined a bowling team last year because Bianca thought it would be fun and ended up making good friends :) Below you will find some images from our time together along with the logo we represented :3 You will also find some songs that I recommend :p</p>
